 Ada Augusta, Countess of Lovelace, was a most romantic figure
 in the history of computing. Ada, the daughter of Lord Byron
 (the English poet), was a skilled mathematician. She
 became interested in Babbage’s work on the analytical engine
 and extended his ideas (as well as correcting some of his errors).
 Ada is credited with being the first programmer. The concept
 of the loop—a series of instructions that repeat—is
 attributed to her. The programming language Ada, used largely by the United States Department
 of Defense, is named for her.
